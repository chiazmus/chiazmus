## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Andrew, a CS student with a lot of interests!
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning *web development* and *software engineering* with BYU Idaho!
- ðŸ”­ Some of my interests and current projects include
    - A word embedding powered procedural logography (I know, I'm a nerd)
    - Several video game ideas that will probably be abandoned after a few weeks
    - A recipe website for my grandma
    - A retro BASIC emulator/virtual machine

### Programming Languages (*I know, HTML and CSS don't really count*)
